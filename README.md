## Joshua Retallick

A highly driven and ambitious junior web developer with an extensive background in Event Management.

I have recently graduated (Jan 21) from an intensive 12 week course at Makers Academy where I have grown from interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am looking to take on a career in the tech scene of London or Essex where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design.

#### Creative

As a promoter I have learned to be creative in my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.

#### Inquisitive

I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.

#### Enthusiastic

I am highly motivated and unafraid of a challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time consuming tasks.

#### Team-player

Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
