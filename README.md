## Joshua Retallick

A highly driven and ambitious junior web developer with an extensive background in Event Management.  Until recently I owned and operated a successful concert promotions business called Old Empire.  Due to the effects of COVID-19 and an industry that has been put on pause, I decided to reinvest in my education and joined Makers Academy so I could retool my skillset.  Having now graduated, I am looking to harness my broad range of skills from two very different industries with a brand new career path.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[SOS App](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/SOS-Test)**            | An app that recognises the users location (worldwide) and tells them the emergency services number for their location plus directions to the nearest emergency services. | SwiftUI, Swift UIKit, XCode, Google Maps/Places, Core Location. |
| **[Dear Diary](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/dear-diary)**            | This blogging app has been created without generating any scaffolds or the usual Rails helpers. So all routes, models, views and controllers were manually coded by myself which has helped me really delve in to the magic beneath the hood. | Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Mini-Test, JQuery, Bootstrap, Popper, BCrypt. |
| **[Dogbook](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/dogbook)** | A facebook style clone written on the Ruby On Rails framework that allows connections for man's best friend. | Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Capybara, RSpec. |
| **[MakersBnB](https://github.com/joshuaretallick/makersbnb)** | My first entry in to app building via an AirBnB clone.  This is a pretty primitive example but I think it is important to include to compare how far my learning has come since I began coding. | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, RSpec. |

#### Process Review Example

Over the past few months I have undertaken regular reviews of my problem solving process. You can see an example of the feedback I have received here: **[Review](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tdcp531x5ysogz/2021-01-12-Orange%20Pidgeot%2069-feedback.pdf?dl=0)**

#### Creative

As a promoter I have learned to be creative in my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.

#### Inquisitive

I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.

#### Enthusiastic

I am highly motivated and unafraid of a challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time consuming tasks.

#### Team-player

Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
